A Å‚aw requiring services to enable auto experts of personal data

Protecting privacy is good. However it is not enought. People should be able to gather, archive, browse and analyse all data they possess and every data they see.

However now it is very hard to gather these data from services. Therefore there is a need for a law that forces companies to enable users to set up automatic exports of all data to  a given URL of users consuming service. The data should be sent in a standardized format with a given frequency. Eg. Once per hour, day, month. 

That way users will be able to collect their data, regaining the control over them. It will also allow new startups to be created that will generate helpful tools to gather, analyse these data for the benefit of their owners.
